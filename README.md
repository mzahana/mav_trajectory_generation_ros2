# mav_trajectory_generation_ros2
This is a ROS 2 version of the original [mav_trajectory_generation](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation/tree/master) repository.  This pkg is used to generate feasible multi-rotor trajectories. Not all the packages are ported to ROS 2, only the core package [mav_trajectory_generation](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_trajectory_generation/tree/master/mav_trajectory_generation)
